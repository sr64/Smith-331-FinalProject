My chosen datasets are of reptile and/or arthropod collection data from urban/suburban environments, as well as nucleotide sequencing data from some of the species collected within those datasets. I am planning to analyze the similarity between the features of the captured species, as well as the fluctuations in population/species composition (based on # of captures) over time. I also want to analyze nucleotide sequence data of some of the observed species, to see similarities in the genomes of different reptile/arthropods and to see how similarity based on genetic data compares to similarity based on feature vectors.
